# FeesApp
The app is a way to digitalize the process of fee management. 
Admin can login, add students, view list of students and change the payment status of students 
Students can login and see their payment status, if they have paid the fees then the Text to speech function generates a speech "FEES PAID"
if not "FEES NOT PAID"
